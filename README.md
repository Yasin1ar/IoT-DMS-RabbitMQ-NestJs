# IoT X-ray Data Management System

## 📌 Overview
This is a NestJS-based API that processes x-ray data from IoT devices using RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

## 🚀 Features
- **RabbitMQ Integration** for processing real-time x-ray signals.
- **MongoDB Storage** with Mongoose.
- **RESTful API** with Swagger Documentation.
- **IoT Simulator** that generates and sends fake x-ray data.
